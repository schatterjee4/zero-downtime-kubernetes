- Change the deployment definition under `deployment/coffee-shop/deployment.yaml` to use your first image version.
- Run `deployment/deploy-v1.sh`
- Test the running version
- Run `kubectl port-forward <fortio-pod> 8080:8080`, and run `./curl-test.sh` or `./load-test.sh` to test your application
- Browse http://localhost:8080/fortio/browse to see the load test results.
- Change the deployment definition to use your second image version and apply.
- Execute a load test during the deployment and see what happens.
